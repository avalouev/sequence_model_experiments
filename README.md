Experiments with deep learning for sequence models.

## Dinosaur names
In this notebook I build a simple character-level LSTM to generate new dinosaur names one character at a time.

## Russian names
In this notebook I use character-level LSTM to generate new russian old style slavic names. I scraped the web to collect 6134 old slavic / russian names from various website and used that as a training data for the model.
